# WeatherUpdate (Java)

Files are provided in a single top-level folder for easy access.


## What is included

- MainActivity.java
- activity_main.xml
- AndroidManifest.xml
- build.gradle (project)
- app-build.gradle
- settings.gradle
- README.md

## How to import

1. Open Android Studio, create a new Project (Empty Activity) with package name `com.example.weatherupdate`.
2. Replace the generated MainActivity.java, AndroidManifest.xml and res/layout/activity_main.xml with the files in this folder.
3. Add the project-level and app-level gradle files if you want to import as a Gradle project.
4. Replace `YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` in MainActivity.java with your API key.

## Notes

- This zip intentionally contains a single top-level folder (WeatherUpdate) with files at its root to match your request.
- If you want a full Android Studio project structure instead, tell me and I'll produce it, but per your request this is flattened for simplicity.
